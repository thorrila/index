    <h1>Stærðfræðigreining III - Glósur</h1>

    <h2>1. Tvinntölur</h2>
    <p>
        Alright, here’s the deal with tvinntölur (complex numbers). They’re just numbers that have two parts: a real part (the usual numbers you know) and an imaginary part (which sounds fake, but it’s very real in math terms). These numbers look like \( z = x + yi \), where \( x \) is the real part and \( y \) is the imaginary part. The \( i \) here stands for the "imaginary unit" and satisfies \( i^2 = -1 \). So yeah, imaginary numbers aren’t just for sci-fi—they’re a core part of math.
    </p>
    <p>
        Geometrically, tvinntölur live in their own plane called the complex plane. Imagine a graph: the x-axis is the real part, and the y-axis is the imaginary part. Each complex number \( z = x + yi \) is a point on this plane. Want to know how far it is from the origin? Just use \( |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is called the "modulus" or "absolute value." The angle it makes with the x-axis is called the "argument" and can be found with \( \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \).
    </p>
    <p>
        But what’s the point of all this? Well, tvinntölur are incredibly useful. They’re used in everything from electrical engineering to quantum physics. They’re especially handy when dealing with oscillations, rotations, and waves. For example, if you multiply two complex numbers, it’s like rotating and scaling them in the complex plane. This makes them amazing for describing things like sound waves, alternating current in circuits, or even vibrations.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the coolest things about tvinntölur is their connection to Euler’s formula:
        \[
        e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta).
        \]
        This little gem ties together exponentials, trigonometry, and complex numbers in one elegant package. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of math.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tvinntölur also let us solve equations that are impossible with just real numbers. Take \( x^2 + 1 = 0 \), for example. There’s no real number solution, but in the world of tvinntölur, it’s easy: \( x = \pm i \). They’re also the key to solving all polynomial equations (shoutout to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra).
    </p>
    <p>
        So yeah, tvinntölur might seem weird at first, but they’re everywhere. If you’re into engineering, physics, or just cool math, you’ll be using them a lot. Plus, they make boring equations way more interesting.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Fáguð föll</h2>
    <p>
        Fáguð föll, or analytic functions, are like the perfectionists of the math world. These are functions that behave super predictably and smoothly—they’re differentiable not just once, but infinitely many times. They’re basically the "good guys" of tvinntalnagreining (complex analysis).
    </p>
    <p>
        The coolest thing about fáguð föll is that you can represent them with power series. That means if \( f(z) \) is analytic at \( z_0 \), you can write it as:
        \[
        f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (z-z_0)^n.
        \]
        This is huge because it means you can know everything about the function just by looking at its behavior near \( z_0 \). No surprises here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why do we care? Because fáguð föll are the foundation for almost all of complex analysis. They’re used to describe physical phenomena like fluid flow, electromagnetic fields, and even heat distribution. Plus, they’ve got amazing properties, like how they let you calculate integrals in super-easy ways using Cauchy’s theorems (more on that later).
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing: analytic functions are either 100% smooth and predictable or they blow up in your face (at singularities). But even when they blow up, we can still learn a lot from them. That’s where stuff like residues and poles come in, but we’ll get to that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of fáguð föll include \( e^z \), \( \ln(z) \), and \( \sin(z) \). These are functions you already know, but in the complex world, they have even cooler properties. For example, the exponential function doesn’t just describe growth—it also describes rotations (thanks again to \( e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta) \)).
    </p>
    <p>
        So yeah, fáguð föll are like the MVPs of math. They’re smooth, predictable, and incredibly useful in both pure and applied mathematics.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Afleiðujöfnur</h2>
    <p>
        Afleiðujöfnur, or differential equations, are equations that involve a function and its derivatives. These are the bread and butter of anything involving change—whether it’s the speed of a car, the flow of water, or the spread of a disease. If something changes over time or space, you can bet there’s an afleiðujafna describing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two main types: ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). ODEs involve functions of a single variable, like \( y'(t) + y(t) = 0 \), while PDEs involve functions of multiple variables, like \( u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \). Both are super important, but ODEs are usually the starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
        Differential equations can also be classified by their order (how many derivatives are involved), linearity (whether they’re linear or nonlinear), and whether they have constant or variable coefficients. For example, \( y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0 \) is a second-order, linear ODE with constant coefficients.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what’s the goal here? To solve the equation, meaning to find the function \( y(t) \) or \( u(x, t) \) that satisfies it. Sometimes that’s easy, but most of the time it’s a nightmare. That’s why we have special methods like separation of variables, integrating factors, and Laplace transforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        One really cool thing is that solutions to linear equations can be added together. This is called the principle of superposition, and it’s a lifesaver when you’re dealing with complicated systems. For example, if \( y_1(t) \) and \( y_2(t) \) are solutions to a linear ODE, then \( c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t) \) is also a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Differential equations are everywhere. They’re used to describe population growth, electrical circuits, fluid dynamics, and so much more. If you’re solving an afleiðujafna, you’re basically modeling how something in the world behaves.
