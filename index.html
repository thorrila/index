        <h2>Tvinntölur (Complex Numbers)</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine numbers that go beyond the number line. Complex numbers are like points on a plane, with a real part (the x-axis) and an imaginary part (the y-axis). They're written as \( z = x + yi \), where \( i \) is a mysterious number satisfying \( i^2 = -1 \).
        </p>
        <p>
            Why do we care about these numbers? Because they unlock powerful ways to solve problems, like finding roots of equations that real numbers can't handle. For example, the equation \( x^2 + 1 = 0 \) has no solution in real numbers, but in the complex world, it's easy: \( x = \pm i \).
        </p>
        <p>
            Complex numbers also let us elegantly describe rotations and oscillations. Think of Euler's formula: \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \). This beauty connects geometry, algebra, and calculus.

    <div class="content-section" id="fagud-foll">
        <h2>Fáguð föll (Analytic Functions)</h2>
        <p>
            What makes a function "fágud" (analytic)? It's like being the ultimate smooth operator in mathematics. An analytic function is infinitely differentiable and has a power series representation, meaning it can be written as \( f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (z - z_0)^n \).
        </p>
        <p>
            Analytic functions are the heart of complex analysis. They behave predictably and have incredible properties, like the fact that knowing their behavior on a tiny patch determines them everywhere. This is why they're called "analytic"—it's all about being able to analyze them fully.
        </p>

    <div class="content-section" id="cauchy">
        <h2>Cauchy-setningin (Cauchy's Theorem)</h2>
        <p>
            Cauchy's theorem is the magician's hat of complex analysis: it pulls amazing results out of seemingly simple assumptions. It says that if a function \( f(z) \) is analytic in a region and you integrate it around a closed loop in that region, the result is zero:
            \[
            \oint_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 0
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            This means analytic functions are "conservative"—no net change happens when you loop around. From this, you get magical results like the Cauchy integral formula, which tells you the value of \( f(z) \) anywhere inside the loop just from its values on the loop. It's the ultimate recycling principle of math!
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="content-section" id="leifareikningur">
        <h2>Leifareikningur (Residue Calculus)</h2>
        <p>
            Residues are like the essence of a function near a singularity (a "problematic" point). They make calculating integrals much simpler. The residue theorem tells you:
            \[
            \oint_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum \text{Res}(f, a_k)
            \]
            where the sum runs over all singularities inside the loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why is this cool? Because it simplifies complicated real integrals into bite-sized calculations using the residues of the function.
        </p>
        <a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to Top</a>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section" id="laplace">
        <h2>Laplace-ummyndunin (Laplace Transform)</h2>
        <p>
            The Laplace transform is like a teleportation device for functions. It converts a function of time, \( f(t) \), into a function of a complex variable, \( F(s) \):
            \[
            F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{-st} \, dt
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            Why do this? Because it turns differential equations into algebraic ones, which are much easier to solve. After solving, you use the inverse Laplace transform to return to the original time domain.
